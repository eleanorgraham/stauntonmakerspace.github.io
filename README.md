Pre-Requirements:
=====================
You will need to have Ruby installed, and then "gem install jekyll"
And then deal with all the insuing hate and anger that comes with 
software systems to promise simplicity, then fail you.

How to Run Locally:
======================
jekyll serve


Coverting Video:
======================
Given a proper mp4 file from Ashby or others, run 
```
$ ffmpeg -i woodworking_sms.mp4 -acodec libvorbis -vcodec libtheora woodworking_sms.ogv 
```
This gives you an alternate ogg file that can be read by open source browsers / operating systems.




These are notes from the original theme we repurposed for the Staunton Makerspace Website.
