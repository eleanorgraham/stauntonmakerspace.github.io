We hope the Staunton Makerspace will grow to support collaboration across boundaires of science and art, technlogy and craft, to invent novel objects and works of art.  Check out our <a href="https://github.com/stauntonmakerspace/wikiProject/wiki">Equipment Wiki</a> for more information about our tools.  The Makerspace is located at 222 S. Washington St. just a few steps outside lovely downtown Staunton Virginia.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">Are you telecommuting to work, or running a small business out of your house?  Co-working locations offer a collegiate working environment that provides shared resources (such as high speed internet and an espresso machine) in a clean open space that offers an office like atmosphere that can make your day a little brighter and friendlier.  As the Makerspace has grown we've established an agreement with Votr (a local tech startup) to help seperate the noisy workshop from the quieter desk workers.  You can find the co-working space at 101 W. Frederick St. on the third floor.</p>
